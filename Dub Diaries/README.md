# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

We are a group of informatics students looking to improve the journaling world by creating an easy-to-use journal and diary for UW students. This website features a classic diary you can use to reflect on your day, but also includes many trackers that can keep you organized, and a statistics page to help you see what your life is like holistically using charts.

We hope you enjoy our diary page! Go Dawgs!
