                What is the problem? Why does it need addressing? What other 
                solutions are there and how are they insufficient?
            </h2>
            <p class="contextanswer">
                Students are constantly juggling academics, social life, extracurricular 
                activities, and personal time, keeping track of their time through a paper 
                planner or online calendar. To balance everything, students need to be able 
                to stay organized and remember to take care of themselves as well. This can 
                prove to be difficult for a lot of students as many don’t know how to utilize 
                resources available to them and/or may be afraid to reach out to peers and 
                professors. We aim to streamline habit tracking and organization through our 
                app to make it easy for students to stay on track with their commitments 
                and mental health.

                A lot of online journaling apps are not very customizable - whether it limits
                entries to certain questions or has a giant paywall, students want to 
                feel listened to and heard; even through a web application. 
                <a href="https://www.bluefever.com/">Blue Fever</a> 
                is one example of a mobile app that addresses this issue similarly through 
                sharing journal entries anonymously with other users as a way of venting 
                or for support. There is also a mobile app called Daylio which emphasizes 
                tracking habits through very short questions, also including more traditional 
                journaling features. <a href="https://daylio.net/">Daylio</a> is interesting in 
                that there’s no writing - just a lot of tapping, emphasizing visuals and statistics 
                over words. With our app, we want to avoid the emphasis on social media like on 
                Blue Fever, incorporate both short and long-form journaling into a way to track 
                habits, and most importantly, maintain the focus on UW students and privacy.

                Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
            </h2>
            <p class="answer1">
                Our users will be UW students who are looking to find a way to 
                organize their busy schedules and lives. We had found that a lot of 
                organization/tracking applications are very general and do not focus 
                only on students, so we wanted to make an application that would be 
                more specific and easier to use. We also found that many applications 
                have a lot of specific features that are marked as “premium” and 
                force you to pay to use them, but since we will guarantee to our users that everything we design will be free, we believe that this 
                app will benefit minority groups such as students on financial aid as 
                they won’t be excluded and will be able to access the entire 
                application. In addition, our application will be web-based, and 
                because you will not need a phone to access the information, it will 
                even be accessible to people that do not have their own devices 
                (since your information will be saved with your email, you can access 
                this application from libraries and other tech resource centers). It 
                will also help those who want to get help but are unable to reach out 
                due to not knowing who to contact or because of busy daily routines 
                as users can find helpful, relevant resources in one place. In 
                addition, journaling and tracking daily habits and lifestyle changes 
                will help reveal the user’s mental/physical health status, and will 
                help students recognize when they should reach out to others for 
                help.

                What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! What kind of information will the users be viewing? 
            </h2>
            <p class="answer2">
                We hope to make this journal extremely personalizable so every student can use it to their liking. Some simple interactive features include text layout, font, color, and text size customizations. We also want to make it possible for users to import their own photos as journal covers or photo entries. The main purpose is for users to be able to keep track of their daily occurrences. We would also require that users create an account and login to the web pages so that every user can have their own personalized experience. Besides written journal entries, we want users to have the option to add mood tracking, eating habits, class schedules, time they woke up or went to sleep, and other small details about their day. This data can then be used to produce visuals such as mood color charts, sleep time graphs, bar charts of steps, and more so users can see the visualization of their habits.

                One creative idea we thought of was a mood of the day hex color picker. Hex colors can be chosen through RGB range, gray-scale range, and opacity. If we assign certain emotions to each range (for example, RGB range could represent happiness to sadness on a scale, gray-scale could be productive to tired, etc.) then the result would be a highly customized color each day. Since this web app is going to be built for UW students, we could also add a campus map where users can mark their class locations. This is a lot of elements for a journal, so we want to add a tutorial so users can understand what features are available, then give the users an option to select which features they want to use.

            <h2 class="question3">How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is,

                Our website will help target the mental health crisis we are dealing with at our UW campus 
                by allowing our peers and staff to frequently keep check on their mental state by having a 
                digital journal that allows them to express their emotions and deliver back feedback such 
                as resources. This will let our users visualize their stats, realizing their trends and 
                where they can improve with their habits. With this all-in-one app, it will minimize the 
                number of applications the user will need to use in their daily life by allowing them to 
                journal ideas, bookmark, and use organizational features which can eventually reduce the stress 
                of writing their daily activities. With our innovative designs and customization options, it 
                will also allow the user to express their creativity in their journal and help with coping 
                with any mental help the user could be dealing with at the moment by defining the tone of colors 
                being utilized in our color mood feature.
